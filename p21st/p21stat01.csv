"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Counts are based on prisoners with any sentence status and were provided by state and federal departments of corrections’ administrative record systems and may not reflect prisoners’ self-identification of race or Hispanic origin. State, federal, and national totals by race or Hispanic origin differ from other tables in this report due to adjustments that BJS made in other tables to correct for differences between administrative records and prisoner self-reported data on race or Hispanic origin. As of December 31, 2001, persons sentenced for a felony in the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).",,,,,,,,,,,,
