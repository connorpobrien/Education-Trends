Imprisonment rate is the number of sentenced prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction per 100,000 U.S. residents or per 100,000 U.S. residents in a given category. Rates are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1, 2022.",,,,,
