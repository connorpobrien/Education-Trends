"Note: Interpret these statistics with caution. Unless otherwise noted, citizenship status is based on prisoners' self-report upon admission to prison. The counts of U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens represent persons held in the physical custody of state or federal correctional authorities and in private prisons, excluding prisoners held in local jails or the custody of other jurisdictions but including prisoners in states with an integrated prison and jail system. Some jurisdictions use prisoners' reported country of birth to determine current citizenship. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. BJS changed the way it measured citizenship in the National Prisoner Statistics program to include all non-U.S. citizens as of the 2016 reference year. See Methodology. As of December 31, 2001, persons sentenced for a felony in the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).",,,,,,,,,
