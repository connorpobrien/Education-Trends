"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Imprisonment rate is the number of sentenced prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction per 100,000 U.S. residents or per 100,000 U.S. residents in a given category. Rates are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1 of the following year. As of December 31, 2001, persons sentenced for a felony in the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Counts for 2019 and earlier may have been revised from previous reports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
