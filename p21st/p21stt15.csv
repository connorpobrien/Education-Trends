"Note: In 2017, BJS began requesting that National Prisoner Statistics respondents include data on all persons age 17 or younger held in the physical custody of state and federal correctional authorities and in private prisons, excluding prisoners held in local jails and in the custody of other jurisdictions. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Counts are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with any sentence status. See Methodology. As of December 31, 2001, persons sentenced for a felony in the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). ",,,
