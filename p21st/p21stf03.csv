"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Estimates show the percent change in the total number of prisoners with any sentence status on December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Prison population data for Idaho in 2022 were not comparable to 2021 data. As of December 31, 2001, persons sentenced for a felony in the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). See table 2 for counts.",,
*Prisons and jails form one integrated system. Data include total jail and prison populations.,,
